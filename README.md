# MasterThesis-DVRP
Simulation and optimization of the Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem created for my master's thesis.

## Overview
Here is a short overview for the project structure:

**Core:** Contains the actual simulation and optimizers (TS, ACS, GA) as well as the needed infrastructure in form of a shared communications library

**DynamicInstanceGenerator:** Creates a bunch of dynamic problem instances based on a static one

**Instances:** Instances created by the DynamicInstanceGenerator that are used in the thesis

**Results:** Contains the raw results of the tests
